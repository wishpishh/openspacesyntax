Open Space Syntax
===============

Prototype web application for performing near real-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_syntax">space syntax</a> of geographic street data.

The outline for the project is that a user should be able to upload street data in some well-defined format(s) that can be converted into an internal format on which a space syntax analysis can be performed server-side, sent back to the client and rendered in the browser.

The "tracer bullet" for the project will consist of implementing one single space syntax analysis algorithm and a very basic rendering, but in the future more algorithms and parameters can be added. The "Choice" algorithm should be a good starting point.
